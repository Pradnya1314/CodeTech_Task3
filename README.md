## AI Chatbot with NLP  


which involves building a simple rule-based AI chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. 
The chatbot can understand basic userinput and respond using pattern-based natural language processing. 

## Objective  
To develop a terminal-based chatbot that interacts with users through typed conversation, matches user input to predefined patterns using regular expressions, and uses NLP concepts 
with NLTK to generate intelligent responses. 

## Tech Stack  
Python 3.x, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Regex (re module) 

## Setup Instructions


### 1. Install dependencies:  
pip install nltk  

### 2. Download NLTK data:  
import nltk  
nltk.download('punkt')  
nltk.download('wordnet') 

## Files Included  
chatbot_nlp.py â€“ Main Python script that runs the chatbot.

nltk_download.py â€“ Optional helper to download required NLTK packages.

Working_chatbot - A screenshot of output.

README.md â€“ Project documentation 

## How to Run  
Open the project in Visual Studio Code or any Python IDE and run:  
python chatbot_nlp.py  
Then interact with the chatbot in the terminal. To exit, type: quit

## Sample Interaction  
ðŸ¤– Welcome to Chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.
